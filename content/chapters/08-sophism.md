## Day 1: Explore Obstacles to Knowledge

What prevents attaining knowledge? Why? Consider classic obstacles, then add your own.

Examples: The obscurity of certain subjects; The brevity of life

```qa
{
  "id": "8.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "List obstacles to knowledge and explain why they hinder knowing:",
  "columns": ["What prevents attaining knowledge?", "Why does it prevent attaining knowledge?"],
  "rows": 6,
  "prefilled": [
    ["The obscurity of certain subjects", ""],
    ["The brevity of life", ""]
  ]
}
```

## Day 2: Explore Both Sides of a Person

Pick someone you strongly admire or dislike. First, argue your initial view. Then, use Protagoras’s technique to argue the opposite as well as you can, and finally reassess.

[8.2.1] Write the person’s name and your initial rating (1–10; 1 = deepest contempt, 10 = strongest respect)

[8.2.2] Paragraph defending your initial view (praise if you admire; condemn if you despise)

[8.2.3] Paragraph arguing the opposite view (condemn if you praised; praise if you condemned)

[8.2.4] New rating (1–10) after the exercise and a brief explanation of why it did or didn’t change

#### Optional: Argument Scaffolding

Use this table to outline both sides concisely before writing paragraphs.

```qa
{
  "id": "8.2.5",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Structure both positions: initial stance and the best opposing case (steelman)",
  "columns": ["Position (Initial / Opposite)", "Main claim", "Top 2–3 reasons", "Evidence/examples", "Biases to watch"],
  "rows": 2,
  "prefilled": [
    ["Initial", "", "", "", "Confirmation bias, halo/horn effect"],
    ["Opposite (steelman)", "", "", "", "Motivated reasoning, straw person"]
  ]
}
```

## Day 3: Explore Many Sides of an Event

Attribute responsibility across different agents/factors and perspectives.

```qa
{
  "id": "8.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "For each agent/factor, identify whose perspective would judge it responsible and why:",
  "columns": ["Agent/Factor", "Perspective(s)", "Rationale (why this perspective would judge it responsible)"],
  "rows": 6,
  "prefilled": [
    ["The javelin", "", ""],
    ["The man who threw the javelin", "", ""],
    ["The referees", "", ""]
  ]
}
```

#### Optional: Example Perspectives

- The javelin: Safety officials or equipment designers may attribute responsibility to a design/manufacture flaw that increased harm likelihood.
- The thrower: Coaches or sports ethicists may focus on agency and technique choices (recklessness, ignoring conditions, poor form).
- The referees: League governance might see failure to enforce rules or halt play as a contributing responsibility.

## Day 4: Explore Cultural Relativism

Map practices to the (sub)cultures that regard them as fine or just, and explain how they maintain that culture.

```qa
{
  "id": "8.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Examine cultural relativity of practices and their cultural-maintenance role:",
  "columns": ["(Sub)culture", "Action or practice considered ‘fine’ or ‘just’", "How does this clearly maintain the (sub)culture?"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

#### Optional: Example (Sub)cultures and Practices

- Competitive sports teams: Strict punctuality for training; maintains discipline, shared standards, and team cohesion.
- Academic peer review: Anonymous reviewing; maintains perceived impartiality and quality control norms.
- Monastic communities: Shared meals at fixed times; maintains communal identity, routine, and hierarchy.
- Open-source communities: Public code review and issue tracking; maintains transparency, collaboration, and meritocratic norms.
- Corporate sales orgs: Public leaderboards; maintains competitive drive and performance-oriented identity.

## Day 5: Putting It All Together (Protagoras)

[8.5.1] Is your view of Protagoras favorable or unfavorable? Why?

[8.5.2] Review your Day 1 reasons to doubt and apply them to your current view of Protagoras (note any loosened certainty)

[8.5.3] Now defend the opposite view: if you like Protagoras, write a short critique; if you don’t, write a short defense

```qa
{
  "id": "8.5.4",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Final assessment: Given your goals for a life philosophy, is a Protagorean approach useful?",
  "columns": ["Your goals (what you want from a philosophy of life)", "How Protagoras helps (or doesn’t) meet these goals"],
  "rows": 4
}
```

## Final Reflection

[8.reflection] After practicing Protagoras’s approach, what have you learned about arguing both sides, situational responsibility, and cultural relativity? How will you use (or avoid) these tools going forward?
