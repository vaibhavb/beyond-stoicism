# Chapter 9: Academic Skepticism (Carneades)

## Chapter Overview
Practice doubt as a skill. You will learn Carneades’s four grades of assent for impressions, use qualitative Bayesian thinking to gauge how evidence should shift confidence, and finish by arguing both sides of a position to loosen overconfidence and see alternatives more clearly.

## Day 1: Four Grades of Impressions

Classify impressions by Carneades’s scheme: apparent, convincing, undiverted (consistent, multi‑source), or thoroughly explored (well‑integrated, broadly examined). Use the examples below to practice.

```qa
{
  "id": "9.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "For each case, identify the grade: apparent, convincing, undiverted, or thoroughly explored.",
  "columns": ["Impression", "Perceiver/Context", "Grade (apparent/convincing/undiverted/thoroughly explored)", "Why?"],
  "rows": 6,
  "prefilled": [
    ["There’s beer in the fridge", "Someone vaguely recalls there might be a couple left", "", ""],
    ["There’s beer in the fridge", "Someone is looking at two bottles and grabs one", "", ""],
    ["The charge of an electron is 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C", "A physics student using the value from a reliable book", "", ""],
    ["The charge of an electron is 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C", "A physics student who measured it in lab (acceptable error)", "", ""],
    ["Factory‑farmed meat is ethically wrong", "Someone newly disgusted after visiting a slaughterhouse", "", ""]
  ]
}
```

## Day 2: Categorize Your Own Impressions

List a few beliefs or impressions you currently hold, then grade and justify each one.

```qa
{
  "id": "9.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Grade some of your own impressions.",
  "columns": ["Impression", "Grade (apparent/convincing/undiverted/thoroughly explored)", "Justification (why this grade?)"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

---

## Day 3: Qualitative Bayesianism

Update confidence with a light‑touch version of Bayes. Start with a grade for each impression, then note how strongly you hold it (1–5).

P(T|E) ∝ P(E|T) · P(T)

```qa
{
  "id": "9.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Record grade and confidence for several beliefs (1 = not at all strongly, 5 = extremely strongly).",
  "columns": ["Impression", "Grade (apparent/convincing/undiverted/thoroughly explored)", "Confidence (1–5)", "Notes on what could raise/lower it"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

---

## Day 4: Strength of Evidence

Consider how much a piece of evidence should move your confidence by comparing how expected it is if your belief were true vs. false.

O(H|E) = O(H) × [ P(E|H) / P(E|¬H) ]

[9.4.1] Choose one belief. Describe its strongest and weakest evidence and why each should change your confidence a little or a lot.

```qa
{
  "id": "9.4.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Map evidence to its expectedness under your hypothesis vs. its negation (qualitatively).",
  "columns": ["Evidence", "Expected if H", "Expected if not‑H", "Implication (strongly raises / slightly raises / slightly lowers / strongly lowers)"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Day 5: Argue Both Sides

Pick a philosophy from earlier chapters you strongly like or dislike. Record your initial confidence that it’s a good (or poor) fit, then write a short defense and a short critique before reassessing.

[9.5.1] Chosen philosophy and initial 1–10 confidence it’s a good/poor fit for you

[9.5.2] In defense of your chosen philosophy as a good fit for you

[9.5.3] Against your chosen philosophy as a poor fit for you

[9.5.4] New 1–10 confidence after arguing both sides, and why it changed (or didn’t)

## Final Reflection

After practicing Carneades’s grading of impressions, qualitative Bayes, and arguing both sides: Are you missing the ethical direction from the Port of Character or the pleasure focus from the Port of Pleasure, or is the focus on doubt and epistemology a better fit? Which techniques helped instill useful doubt? Would more cultivated doubt benefit your life?

[9.reflection] Summarize what you learned about grading evidence, updating confidence, and debating from both sides. Note how you will apply (or avoid) these tools.
