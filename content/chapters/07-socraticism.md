# Chapter 7: Socraticism

## Chapter Overview
Practice the Socratic method to examine beliefs: define your terms, test definitions, reflect on aporia and intellectual humility, and conduct dialectic (with a friend and, optionally, a stranger). This chapter emphasizes careful questioning and willingness to refine or suspend judgment.

## Day 1: Self-examination, part 1

Begin by surfacing a belief and turning it into a definition question, then list necessary and sufficient conditions.

[7.1.1] Write down one judgment you currently hold about something or someone

[7.1.2] Turn it into a definition question (format: “What is [judgment]?”)

```qa
{
  "id": "7.1.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "List necessary and sufficient conditions that must ALL be met:",
  "columns": ["Condition"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

---

## Day 2: Self-examination, part 2

Test your definition. If it fails, revise and test again.

[7.2.0] Concept under definition (copy from Day 1): “What is …?”

```qa
{
  "id": "7.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Test your necessary and sufficient conditions across versions:",
  "columns": [
    "Version (e.g., Original, Revision 1, Revision 2)",
    "Definition (your wording)",
    "Conditions (summary)",
    "Test cases / counterexamples",
    "Result (Pass/Fail) + why"
  ],
  "rows": 3
}
```

### Optional: Example Definition Testing (Worked)

- Example A — What is “lying”?
  - Original: “Saying something false.”
  - Counterexample: A person who is sincerely mistaken says something false but is not lying.
  - Revision: “Asserting something you believe is false, with intent to deceive.”
  - Further test: “Telling a fictional story” ≠ lying (no intent to deceive); “white lie” = lying (meets belief + intent), though arguably justified in some contexts.

- Example B — What is “courage”?
  - Original: “Facing danger without fear.”
  - Counterexample: Recklessness (acting without proper assessment) or ignorance (no awareness of danger) would count under this definition but shouldn’t.
  - Revision: “Deliberate endurance in the face of recognized fear/danger, for a worthy end, guided by practical judgment.”
  - Further test: Panic‑free thrill‑seeking without risk awareness ≠ courage; prudent retreat to protect others can be compatible with courage.

- Example C — What is “respect”?
  - Original: “Being nice to people.”
  - Counterexample: Niceness from fear or manipulation doesn’t imply respect; respect can involve candid critique.
  - Revision: “Recognizing and appropriately responding to another’s dignity, rights, or role.”
  - Further test: Polite condescension ≠ respect; clear disagreement with reasons can = respect.

## Day 3: Explore your reaction to the Socratic method

[7.3.1] How did you feel while doing the exercises (engaged, frustrated, confused, etc.)?

[7.3.2] Afterward, do you feel more curious about your beliefs (like Theaetetus) or more frustrated/reluctant (like Euthyphro)? Why?

[7.3.3] If you stopped due to aporia, how does that affect your certainty about your original claim?

[7.3.4] If you reached an acceptable definition, how does that affect your certainty about the original claim?

[7.3.5] How might you use this technique in the future? How willing are you to do so?

## Day 4: Dialectic and elenchus with a friend

Apply the six-step Socratic method with a willing partner. Use these prompts to guide the conversation and keep it on track.

[7.4.1] You pose a question

[7.4.2] Your friend’s first answer

```qa
{
  "id": "7.4.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Probe assumptions behind the provisional answer:",
  "columns": ["Assumption", "Why it may be problematic"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

[7.4.4] Your friend’s updated definition

```qa
{
  "id": "7.4.5",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Iterate a few rounds: refine and critique",
  "columns": ["New definition", "Problems with new definition"],
  "rows": 3
}
```

[7.4.6] Why did you stop? Good‑enough provisional explanation, or aporia (insufficient understanding)? Explain.

---

## Day 5: Attempt dialectic/elenchus with a stranger (optional)

[7.5.1] Reflection: If you tried with a stranger, how did it differ from working alone or with a friend? What did you learn about when and with whom to use the method?

[7.5.2] Which aspects of Socrates’s method will you keep using, and which will you leave behind?

## Final Reflection

[7.reflection] How has practicing the Socratic method changed your approach to beliefs and definitions? What will you carry forward, and where will you set boundaries for using this method?
