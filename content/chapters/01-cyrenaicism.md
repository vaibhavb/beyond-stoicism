## Day 2: Introduce more pleasure into your life

### Step 1
Think about one thing in your life that you get physical comfort or pleasure from that could be done more easily or bring more pleasure. This could be something you already do that brings you pleasure but could be made better or easier (for instance, getting a massaging shower head: You already bathe, so why not make it more pleasant!). Or it could be something that's missing from your life that could bring pleasure. Remember that the Cyrenaics believed physical pleasures and pains were the main focus in life, so try it for yourself!

[1.2.1] What physical comfort or pleasure could you enhance or introduce?

### Step 2
Think of ways to increase physical enjoyment, decrease physical discomfort when obtaining it, or both. This could be bringing something new into your life or trying to make an existing aspect of your life easier. For example, if you enjoy cooking delicious meals but have trouble digging through your pots and pans, you could plan to reorganize your kitchen to make it easier to cook.

[1.2.2] How will you increase physical enjoyment or decrease discomfort?

### Step 3
Execute your plan and enjoy! The final step is to try it out and see how it goes. It's not a problem if it takes a few days to execute your plan. You'll be prompted to collect your thoughts about all these exercises at the end of the week.

[1.2.3] How did it go? What was your experience?

## Day 3: Remove some pain from your life

### Step 1
Think about one thing in your life that causes you physical discomfort that would be relatively easy to mitigate. Our days are filled with minor difficulties that lead to unnecessary physical discomfort. Daily routines and chores are two such examples for a lot of people. Perhaps there's something you can do to make them less uncomfortable. Keep in mind that we're focusing on physical discomforts, not mental ones!

[1.3.1] What physical discomfort could you easily mitigate?

### Step 2
Come up with ways to mitigate physical discomfort while not forgoing much—if any—physical pleasure. An expensive new couch may be a bit more comfortable, but going into unmanageable debt could lead to a lot more future discomfort, so go small and double-check your hedonic calculation! Some examples of mitigating discomfort are hiring someone to mow your lawn or breaking up physically demanding chores into smaller, less taxing chunks.

[1.3.2] How will you mitigate this discomfort without sacrificing pleasure?

### Step 3
Do it and see how it goes!

[1.3.3] What was the result of implementing your plan?

## Day 4: Trim the excess

### Step 1
Take two minutes to make a list of things you do or own that make your life harder. Don't focus on events that happen to you or circumstances you find yourself in. Instead, list activities you engage in and stuff you own that make your life more difficult than it needs to be, either because you worry about them or because they make you work harder than you have to. They can be large or small, ranging from a cluttered drawer you always find yourself digging through to your new fancy car you're afraid will get dinged.

[1.4.1] List things you do or own that make your life harder

### Step 2
Take another couple of minutes to review your previous list, then cross out anything that does not bring you any bodily pleasure or relieve bodily pain. Remember that the Cyrenaics were much more concerned with physical pleasure and pain, so focus on the physical for now! We'll be tackling mental pleasure and pain in the next chapter.

The things that you crossed off are excessive from a Cyrenaic perspective. Aristippus would advise you to train yourself to eliminate these things entirely. But given that you're just taking Cyrenaicism for a spin, we don't recommend making huge changes based on this exercise alone! That said, if there are small items or activities that jump out at you, drop one of them and see how it feels over the rest of the week as your exercise for today. If nothing jumps out at you, move on to the final step.

[1.4.2] What did you cross out? What might you consider eliminating?

### Step 3
Look at the items from Step 1 that aren't crossed out and ask yourself if there's any way you can make them physically or mentally easier to do or own; if there is, implement your plan. The remaining items from Step 1 give you pleasure, but also some mental or physical discomfort. Your goal is to see if there's any way to make them easier so you can get just as much pleasure from them with less mental or physical stress.

[1.4.3] How can you make the remaining items easier or less stressful?

## Day 5: Discover the easy pleasures

**Your final exercise for this chapter is simple:** Do whatever you'd normally do, but try to enjoy it more by savoring the little things you encounter during your day.

It bears repeating that a Cyrenaic savors life by focusing on the physical pleasures first and foremost. But if none are available, mental pleasures will do (hence Aristippus's joy when conversing with the locals after being ship-wrecked). This requires a shift in attitude, knowing where to direct your attention, and a little mental energy. Here are some ideas on how to savor whatever comes your way during the course of your day.

### Physical savoring by focusing on the senses:
- Pay attention to the taste of the food you're eating. Chew more slowly and focus on the flavor.
- Take a relaxed position when sitting or lying down. Occasionally tune in to the relaxed sensation of your muscles.
- Turn your attention to pleasant sights, sounds, and smells you encounter throughout your day, be it interesting street art, the sleek design of a car, the smells wafting from a bakery, or the greenery along the sidewalk.

[1.5.1] What did you notice when you focused on savoring the little pleasures? What sights, sounds, tastes, or sensations stood out?

## Final Reflection

Now that you've dipped your toes into Cyrenaicism, take some time to reflect on its fruits. You've explored four types of Cyrenaic exercise: getting more bodily pleasure, minimizing bodily pain, trimming things from your life that don't produce pleasure, and learning to enjoy what easily comes your way. Which of these worked best for you, and which didn't? Which do you think you'd like to practice more in the future? And what's your impression of Cyrenaicism as a life philosophy in general?

[1.reflection] Reflect on your week with Cyrenaicism. Which exercises worked best? What's your overall impression of this philosophy?
