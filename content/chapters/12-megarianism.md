# Chapter 12: Megarianism

## Chapter Overview
Another entry in “Here Be Dragons”, this chapter is prompt‑based rather than a 5‑day plan. Explore practical takeaways from the Megarians: reorienting pursuits (inspired by Stilpo), how we know the good (reason vs. perception), and whether working with paradoxes (Master Argument, Sorites) has value. Conclude by listing ideas you might keep.

## Replace and Reorient (Stilpo)

Stilpo replaced “youthful devotion to wine and voluptuous living” with philosophy and found finer friends and companions. Would replacing some hobbies or activities similarly benefit you? If yes, outline a concrete plan.

```qa
{
  "id": "12.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Plan replacements that align pursuits with your values and community.",
  "columns": ["Current hobby/activity", "Proposed replacement", "Expected benefit (virtue/friendship/skill/health)", "Risks/tradeoffs", "First small step"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

[12.1.2] Briefly describe the kind of “finer companions” you hope to attract with these shifts and how you’ll create proximity to them

## Knowing the Good (Reason vs. Perception)

Megarians held that matter doesn’t really exist; only the Good/Reason/God does—and that this is known by rational, not sensual, perception. Do you think ethical truths can be derived from reason alone, or do we also need perceptual facts and experience? Defend your view, focusing on how we can know what’s good.

[12.2.1] Essay: How do you think we come to know ethical truths—reason alone, experience, or both? Defend your answer with one example

```qa
{
  "id": "12.2.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Map methods of knowing to strengths, limits, and your stance.",
  "columns": ["Method (pure reason / perception & experience / mixed)", "Strengths for ethics", "Limits / pitfalls", "Your position (when to rely on it)"],
  "rows": 4
}
```

## Paradoxes and Use (Master Argument, Sorites)

If you think it isn’t worth investing time in paradoxes like the Master Argument or Sorites, defend your view. If you think there is practical value, what is it—clarifying commitments, sharpening definitions, or reducing overconfidence?

```qa
{
  "id": "12.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Extract practical takeaways from paradox work, or argue against investing time.",
  "columns": ["Paradox or puzzle", "Core tension it exposes", "Practical insight (what it teaches)", "Application (decision/risk/communication)"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

[12.3.2] Optional short defense against paradox‑work: why it’s not worth your time (opportunity cost, confusion, low transfer)

## Ideas to Keep (Megarian Takeaways)

Catalog any specific Megarian ideas you found interesting or useful.

```qa
{
  "id": "12.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "List ideas to keep and how you’ll test them.",
  "columns": ["Idea", "Why it resonates", "One‑week test / metric", "Keep, modify, or drop?"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Final Reflection

What, if anything, from Megarianism will you integrate (reoriented pursuits, methods for knowing the good, or working with paradoxes)? If you reject it, state why clearly. Note one experiment you will run next week.
