# Chapter 11: Pythagoreanism

## Chapter Overview
In the “Here Be Dragons” section, this chapter offers prompts instead of a 5‑day plan. Explore how metaphysical beliefs inform ethics, whether “friendship is equality” fits your life, what political risks you would accept, and which Pythagorean practices you might adopt.

## Metaphysics and Ethics

Recall the opening story: Pythagoras intervenes to save an abused dog because he believes it has the soul of a deceased friend. Consider one metaphysical belief you hold (e.g., about God, the soul, or objective morality) and how it shapes your ethics.

```qa
{
  "id": "11.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Map one or more metaphysical beliefs to downstream ethical views and behaviors.",
  "columns": ["Metaphysical belief (what is real?)", "Ethical beliefs influenced", "Concrete behaviors this pushes you toward"],
  "rows": 4
}
```

[11.1.2] Write a short paragraph explaining one pathway by which your metaphysics shapes a specific ethical stance you hold

## Friendship and Equality

Pythagoreans emphasized a distinctive ideal: “friendship is equality,” illustrated by Damon and Phintias valuing each other’s lives equally and by communal property.

[11.2.1] Do you agree that friendship is (or should aim toward) equality? Why or why not?

```qa
{
  "id": "11.2.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Articulate your own standard for friendship and how it differs from the Pythagorean view.",
  "columns": ["Your standard for friendship", "Practical implications (boundaries, reciprocity, property)", "Tensions with ‘friendship is equality’"],
  "rows": 3
}
```

## Politics and Persecution

The Pythagoreans were persecuted for political involvement. Define the limits of political risk you would accept in pursuit of justice or reform.

[11.3.1] Under what circumstances would you accept persecution (social, professional, legal) for political action? Be specific

[11.3.2] Where would you draw the line and avoid politics if it meant persecution? Why?

## Useful Practices

Identify ideas, practices, or habits from Pythagoreanism that could serve you. Consider communal generosity, disciplined living, mathematical or musical harmony as life‑ordering metaphors, dietary rules, silence, or daily self‑examination.

```qa
{
  "id": "11.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Select practices to try and plan first steps.",
  "columns": ["Idea or practice", "Why it appeals / hoped benefit", "First small step", "How you’ll evaluate"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Final Reflection

Summarize what (if anything) from Pythagoreanism you would integrate. If you reject it, state why clearly (metaphysics, friendship ideal, politics, or lifestyle). Note one experiment you will run in the next week inspired by this chapter.
