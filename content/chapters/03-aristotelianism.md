## Day 1: Understanding Virtue

Aristotle taught that virtue (arete) is excellence of character developed through habit. Unlike talents or skills, virtues are acquired through repeated practice of good actions until they become second nature.

### Morning Reflection: Your Current Virtues

Think about your character strengths. What virtues do you already practice regularly?

[3.1.1] List three character strengths you consistently demonstrate

```qa
{
  "id": "3.1.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Reflect on how you developed these virtues:",
  "columns": ["Virtue", "How You Developed It", "How It Benefits Others"],
  "rows": 3
}
```

### The Nature of Virtue

Aristotle distinguished between two types of virtues:
- **Moral virtues**: Excellence of character (courage, honesty, compassion)
- **Intellectual virtues**: Excellence of mind (wisdom, understanding, practical judgment)

Both types work together to create human flourishing (eudaimonia).

### Evening Practice: Virtue in Action

[3.1.3] Describe a situation today where you had the opportunity to practice virtue. What did you do?

[3.1.4] How might you have acted more virtuously in this situation?

---

## Day 2: The Golden Mean

The Golden Mean is Aristotle's principle that virtue typically lies between extremes of excess and deficiency. Courage, for example, is the mean between cowardice (deficiency) and recklessness (excess).

### Morning Analysis: Finding Your Means

```qa
{
  "id": "3.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Identify the golden mean for these character traits:",
  "columns": ["Deficiency", "Virtue (Mean)", "Excess"],
  "rows": 5,
  "prefilled": [
    ["Cowardice", "Courage", "Recklessness"],
    ["Stinginess", "", "Wasteful spending"],
    ["", "Honesty", "Brutal tactlessness"],
    ["Pushover", "", "Aggression"],
    ["", "Confidence", "Arrogance"]
  ]
}
```

### Personal Application

Think about areas where you tend toward extremes:

[3.2.2] In what situations do you tend to be excessive? (too much of something)

[3.2.3] In what situations do you tend to be deficient? (too little of something)

### Practice Exercise: Calibrating Your Response

Choose one tendency (excess or deficiency) to work on today.

[3.2.4] What specific situation will you use to practice finding the golden mean?

```qa
{
  "id": "3.2.5",
  "type": "fill_in_blank",
  "context": "Goal: Practice the golden mean",
  "prompt": "When I encounter _______, instead of my usual _______ response, I will aim for _______ by _______."
}
```

## Day 3: Practical Wisdom (Phronesis)

Practical wisdom is the intellectual virtue that enables us to deliberate well about human affairs and choose the right action in particular circumstances.

### Morning Reflection: Decision-Making Process

[3.3.1] Describe a recent difficult decision you had to make. What factors did you consider?

### The Elements of Practical Wisdom

Aristotle identified key components of wise decision-making:
1. **Understanding the situation** clearly
2. **Considering consequences** for yourself and others
3. **Weighing competing values** and priorities
4. **Choosing the timing** for action
5. **Acting with appropriate means**

### Practical Wisdom Exercise

Think of a current situation where you need to make a decision:

[3.3.2] Briefly describe the situation

```qa
{
  "id": "3.3.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Apply practical wisdom to analyze your decision:",
  "columns": ["Element", "Your Analysis"],
  "rows": 5,
  "prefilled": [
    ["Understanding the situation", ""],
    ["Potential consequences", ""],
    ["Competing values at stake", ""],
    ["Right timing considerations", ""],
    ["Appropriate means/methods", ""]
  ]
}
```

[3.3.4] Based on this analysis, what action do you think demonstrates practical wisdom?

## Day 4: Friendship and Community

Aristotle taught that humans are social beings who flourish through relationships. He identified three types of friendship: utility, pleasure, and virtue-based friendships.

### Morning Reflection: Your Relationships

```qa
{
  "id": "3.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Categorize some of your relationships:",
  "columns": ["Person/Type", "Based on Utility", "Based on Pleasure", "Based on Virtue"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

### The Highest Form of Friendship

Virtue-based friendships are the most fulfilling because they involve:
- Mutual respect for each other's character
- Shared commitment to moral excellence
- Genuine care for the other's wellbeing
- Stability through life's changes

### Community Engagement

[3.4.2] How do you currently contribute to your community (family, workplace, neighborhood, etc.)?

[3.4.3] What additional contribution could you make that would help others flourish?

### Practice: Acts of Virtue in Relationship

[3.4.4] Choose one relationship to focus on today. How will you practice virtue in this relationship?

```qa
{
  "id": "3.4.5",
  "type": "fill_in_blank",
  "context": "Goal: Strengthen virtue-based connection",
  "prompt": "I will demonstrate _______ (virtue) toward _______ (person) by _______ (specific action)."
}
```

## Day 5: The Good Life (Eudaimonia)

Eudaimonia is often translated as "happiness," but it means something deeper: human flourishing or living well. It's not a feeling but a way of being that comes from actualizing your potential through virtue.

### Morning Contemplation: What Makes Life Good?

[3.5.1] How do you currently define a "good life"?

[3.5.2] How has your understanding of the good life changed over time?

### Aristotelian Elements of Flourishing

According to Aristotle, eudaimonia includes:
- **Virtue in action**: Living according to excellence of character
- **Rational activity**: Using your mind well
- **External goods**: Basic necessities and some advantages
- **Time**: A complete life, not just moments
- **Community**: Thriving in relationship with others

### Personal Flourishing Assessment

```qa
{
  "id": "3.5.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Evaluate your current flourishing:",
  "columns": ["Element", "Current State (1-10)", "What Would Improve This"],
  "rows": 5,
  "prefilled": [
    ["Virtue in action", "", ""],
    ["Using reason well", "", ""],
    ["Basic needs met", "", ""],
    ["Quality relationships", "", ""],
    ["Sense of purpose", "", ""]
  ]
}
```

### Creating Your Aristotelian Life Plan

[3.5.4] Based on this week's exploration, what three virtues do you most want to develop?

[3.5.5] What specific practices will you implement to cultivate these virtues?

```qa
{
  "id": "3.5.6",
  "type": "fill_in_blank",
  "context": "Goal: Design your path to flourishing",
  "prompt": "My vision of eudaimonia includes: _______ (virtue focus), _______ (community engagement), and _______ (rational activity)."
}
```
