# Chapter 4: Stoicism

## Chapter Overview

## Day 1: Epictetus’s Rule

Get familiar with the Stoic distinction by classifying situations as up to you or not up to you.

```qa
{
  "id": "4.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "For each situation, decide: is it up to you or not up to you?",
  "columns": ["Situation", "Up to you or not up to you?"],
  "rows": 10,
  "prefilled": [
    ["An unusually bad traffic jam makes you late for work even though you left home with plenty of time to spare.", ""],
    ["Your boss yells at you when you arrive late.", ""],
    ["You’re very upset that your boss yelled at you for being late, even though it wasn’t your fault.", ""],
    ["Your boss chastises you publicly for some sloppy work you know is your fault.", ""],
    ["You get injured.", ""],
    ["You hate getting injured.", ""],
    ["Wanting to speak up against injustice.", ""],
    ["Failing to speak up against a specific injustice because you were afraid.", ""],
    ["Wanting to move your finger.", ""],
    ["Moving your finger.", ""]
  ]
}
```

[4.1.2] Optional: Based on your responses, what patterns do you notice about what is and isn’t up to you?

## Day 2: Others’ Passions

Look for examples of other people’s passions (fear, greed, anger, etc.) over the course of your day. Reflect on how focusing on what’s not up to them could have contributed to these passions.

[4.2.1] Describe one or two situations you observed and how “not up to you” thinking may have fueled those passions

---

## Day 3: Your Passion

Notice a passion of your own that arose today. Reflect on the situation and how it could have arisen by focusing on what wasn’t up to you.

[4.3.1] Describe the situation and the passion that arose (fear, greed, anger, etc.)

[4.3.2] How might attention to what is up to you have changed your experience or response?

---

## Days 4 and 5: Apply the Rule

For the next two days, actively apply Epictetus’s rule in real time whenever you notice a passion arising. At the end of each day, reflect on the experience.

[4.4.1] Reflections on your first day of “applying the rule”

[4.5.1] Reflections on your second day of “applying the rule”

---

## Final Reflection

Now that you’ve practiced focusing on what’s up to you, reflect on your experience with Epictetus’s rule. What did you find challenging? If you continuously applied the rule, would it improve your life? How?
