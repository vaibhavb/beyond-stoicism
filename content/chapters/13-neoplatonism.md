## Worldview Fit

If you hold a mystical or religious worldview: In what ways is Neoplatonism similar to your views, and how does it differ? If you are more atheistic or scientifically minded: Identify at least one aspect of Neoplatonism that accords with your worldview.

```qa
{
  "id": "13.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Compare your worldview with Neoplatonism (similarities/differences).",
  "columns": ["Theme (e.g., the One, intellect, soul, ascent)", "Your worldview (position/intuition)", "Neoplatonist view (Plotinus/Porphyry/Proclus)", "Similarity / difference"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Progress: Gradual or Sudden

Porphyry emphasizes gradual ethical/spiritual progress; Plotinus allows for sudden insight or “enlightenment.” Which do you find more plausible for yourself? Why? What tends to drive your growth? Have any experiences triggered rapid change?

```qa
{
  "id": "13.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Map experiences to progress type and mechanism.",
  "columns": ["Experience (life/challenge/practice)", "Gradual or sudden?", "Mechanism (discipline, contemplation, crisis, grace)", "Effect on conduct"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Value Across Traditions

Proclus held that all religions have value. If you’re religious, do you agree? Why or why not? If not religious, reflect instead on whether all philosophies have some value, and which parts of religion (ritual, community, myth, contemplation) might still matter to you.

```qa
{
  "id": "13.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Consider value across traditions and what you would borrow.",
  "columns": ["Tradition (religion/philosophy)", "What has value for you", "Why it’s valuable (virtue, meaning, practice)", "How you’d incorporate it"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

## Ideas to Keep (Neoplatonist Takeaways)

Catalog interesting or practicable Neoplatonist ideas: ascent through contemplation, ordering life by hierarchy of goods, cultivating interior stillness, practices of attention, or metaphors of emanation and return.

```qa
{
  "id": "13.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "List ideas to keep and a small experiment to try.",
  "columns": ["Idea / practice", "Why it appeals", "One‑week experiment", "How you’ll evaluate"],
  "rows": 6
}
```
