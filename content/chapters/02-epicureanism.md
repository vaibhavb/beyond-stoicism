# Chapter 2: Epicureanism

## Chapter Overview

Epicureanism focuses on the pursuit of proper pleasure and the avoidance of pain, with a sophisticated understanding of different types of desires and pleasures. Unlike the Cyrenaics who focused primarily on physical pleasures, Epicureans developed a more nuanced approach to pleasure that emphasized long-term happiness and tranquility.

## Days 2 and 3: Cataloging your current life

For the next two days, you'll observe and categorize your own desires and pleasures according to Epicurean categories.

### Day 2: First Day of Observation

```qa
{
  "id": "2.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Record your desires and pleasures throughout the day:",
  "columns": ["Desire or pleasure", "Type of desire (natural/unnatural + necessary/unnecessary) or type of pleasure (kinetic/katastematic)"],
  "rows": 8
}
```

### Day 3: Second Day of Observation

```qa
{
  "id": "2.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Continue recording your desires and pleasures:",
  "columns": ["Desire or pleasure", "Type of desire (natural/unnatural + necessary/unnecessary) or type of pleasure (kinetic/katastematic)"],
  "rows": 8
}
```

## Days 4 and 5: Pursue proper pleasures

Plan your next two days to focus on katastematic (stable) pleasures rather than kinetic (active) pleasures.

### Planning Your Days

```qa
{
  "id": "2.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Use this table to plan your approach:",
  "columns": ["Instead of...", "...which is a ___ [type of desire or pleasure]", "I will...", "...which is a ___"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

### Day 4: Implementation
