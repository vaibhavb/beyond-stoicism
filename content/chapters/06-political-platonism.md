## Day 1: Find a Cause

Use these prompts to surface an issue you care about through two lenses: personal frustration and injustice. Then pick one concrete cause to work with this week.

### Personal Frustration

[6.1.1] Are there specific laws, rules, or regulations at any level of government that have negatively affected you?

[6.1.2] Have you found it difficult to make your voice heard in the public sphere? In what ways?

[6.1.3] Have you or anyone close to you experienced difficulties that could have been made better by good public policy or law?

[6.1.4] Are there any current local or regional bills, laws, or ideas under consideration that you favor and that would make your life better?

[6.1.5] Are there political causes or parties you strongly align with based on your experience? Why?

### Injustice

[6.1.6] Who is treated unfairly in your area (local or national)? How could they be treated more fairly?

[6.1.7] Are there abuses of power inside or outside government that you think can be changed?

[6.1.8] What is the most pressing issue that would help the most people (local, national, or global)?

[6.1.9] Who are the most vulnerable people in your area, and how could their lives be made better?

[6.1.10] When did you last witness an act of injustice? What happened, and what would have made it right?

### Choose Your Cause

[6.1.11] The cause I will work with this week is… (describe it clearly)

---

## Day 2: Educate Yourself

Get just enough information to take one simple action. Time-box if needed (e.g., 60–120 minutes).

#### Specific Problems

[6.2.1] What specific problems pertain to your cause? How exactly do they manifest in your region? (Example: for “political corruption,” consider whether it appears as bribery, “revolving door” jobs, etc.)

#### Proposed Solutions

```qa
{
  "id": "6.2.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "List proposed solutions and assess pros/cons:",
  "columns": ["Proposed solution", "Pros", "Cons"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

#### Who’s Working on It

```qa
{
  "id": "6.2.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Identify organizations/people working on the issue:",
  "columns": ["Organization/Person", "Role/Approach", "Contact/Link"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

Tip: Look for nonprofits, local groups, and relevant legislators or bills. The goal is a short list of potential collaborators or targets for outreach/donation.

#### Optional: Resources Lookup

- Legislation/bill trackers: [congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/) (US federal), [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/), [OpenStates](https://openstates.org/) (US states), your city/county/council website, or national/parliament portals (e.g., [europarl.europa.eu](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/)).
- Government directories: [usa.gov](https://www.usa.gov/) (US), open data portals (e.g., [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)) or your country’s equivalents; local agency pages for contacts and calendars.
- Nonprofits/advocacy: Coalition sites, local chapters, and directories (e.g., [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), [Candid/Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/)). Look for groups already active on your issue.
- Local groups: Neighborhood associations, school boards, tenant unions, faith communities, community centers, and event listings/meetups related to your cause.
- Elected officials: Official “find my representative” tools (e.g., [house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative), [senate.gov](https://www.senate.gov/)). Most have staff emails/phones for public comment.
- Research and media: Issue briefs from a range of think tanks, local newspapers, and public policy institutes. Note potential bias and cross-check claims.
- Safety and rights: “Know your rights” resources (e.g., ACLU), and local rules for demonstrations, public comment, and meeting procedures.

## Day 3: Choose Partners

Decide who you’ll work with—or against—regarding your cause.

[6.3.1] Record the specific group(s), representative(s), or stakeholders you will coordinate with (or oppose), and why

---

## Day 4: SMART Action Plan

Draft a plan that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Timed.

```qa
{
  "id": "6.4.1",
  "type": "textarea",
  "prompt": "My action plan (clear, concrete, scheduled):"
}
```

SMART checklist (use this table to ensure each criterion is satisfied):

```qa
{
  "id": "6.4.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "How your plan satisfies each SMART criterion:",
  "columns": ["Criterion", "How it is satisfied"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

Guidance: Specific (clear enough to act now); Measurable (you can tell when it’s done); Achievable (realistic); Relevant (directly tied to your cause); Timed (scheduled with a date/time).

#### Example SMART Plans

- Call your city councilmember: “On Tue 7:30pm, I will call Councilmember [Name] at [phone] to request a yes vote on [bill] and ask for a follow‑up email.” Success = call completed + 3 bullet notes saved.
- Email a legislative aide: “By Fri 5pm, I will email [Aide Name] citing bill [ID], include a 3‑paragraph personal impact story, and request a meeting.” Success = sent email + reply tracked.
- Public comment at a meeting: “At next Wednesday’s 6pm meeting, I will deliver a 2‑minute comment supporting [policy], with 3 cited facts and a clear ask.” Success = spoke on record + copy of remarks archived.
- Join/coordinate with a nonprofit: “By Sunday, I will attend a 1‑hour volunteer orientation at [Org], then sign up for one shift this month focused on [task].” Success = orientation attended + shift scheduled.
- Micro‑donation and outreach: “Tonight by 9pm, I will donate $25 to [Org] and share a brief note with two friends including one action they can take.” Success = donation receipt + 2 messages sent.
- Petition/signature drive: “Saturday 11–12, I will gather 10 signatures at [location] for [initiative], using a 30‑second script.” Success = ≥10 valid signatures + debrief notes.

#### Optional: Call/Email Script Templates

Use these quick builders to draft concise, effective outreach.

```qa
{
  "id": "6.4.3",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Call Script Builder (aim for ~2 minutes; include): Greeting/name, Constituent location, Issue/bill + position, One‑sentence reason, Specific ask, Thank you + callback info",
  "columns": ["Part", "Your text"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

```qa
{
  "id": "6.4.4",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Email Script Builder (sections): Subject, Greeting, Personal tie, Issue/bill + position, 1–3 supporting points, Specific ask, Contact/signature",
  "columns": ["Section", "Your text"],
  "rows": 7
}
```

```qa
{
  "id": "6.4.5",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Public Comment Builder (~2 minutes): Opening (name/affiliation), Stake/experience, Key facts (1–3), Specific ask, Closing",
  "columns": ["Section", "Your text"],
  "rows": 5
}
```

## Day 5: Act + Reflect

Carry out your plan. Then reflect on what happened and what’s next.

[6.5.1] Reflection: What did you do? What effects did it have (or not)? Did any skills from earlier chapters help you act or regulate emotions? How do you feel about yourself afterward? What are possible next steps?

---

## Final Reflection

What did you learn about effective civic action and your role in a just society? How might you continue contributing to this cause (or another) in a sustainable way?

[6.reflection] Summarize your key insights and longer-term commitments
