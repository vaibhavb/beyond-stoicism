## Day 1: Identify Conventions

List social conventions you follow. For each, note whether it is harmful or useless, and how hard it would be for you to act against it (1 = very easy, 5 = very hard).

```qa
{
  "id": "5.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Evaluate social conventions you follow:",
  "columns": [
    "Social convention I follow",
    "Is it harmful? (✓ if yes)",
    "Is it useless? (✓ if yes)",
    "How hard to act against? (1–5)"
  ],
  "rows": 10
}
```

[5.1.2] Based on your list, which 3–5 conventions are candidates for safe, thoughtful flouting? Why?

## Day 2: Plan Norm-Flouting

Plan how you will flout selected norms in a way that avoids physical danger and unnecessary harm to relationships. Use one row per day in the coming practice.

```qa
{
  "id": "5.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Plan your acts of flouting (one per day):",
  "columns": [
    "Social norm to be flouted (from Day 1)",
    "How will you flout it (speech or behavior)?",
    "When specifically will you do it (time, circumstance, etc.)",
    "How hard will this be? (1–5)",
    "Could this put you in physical danger?",
    "Could this harm relationships or others?"
  ],
  "rows": 5
}
```

[5.2.2] Add any safeguards or boundaries to keep the practice safe and aligned with your values.

## Day 3: Execute & Reflect (Days 1–2)

At the end of each day, reflect on your experience. Focus on how you felt at the time, how you felt afterward, any effects your act achieved (or didn’t), and whether it gets easier over time.
