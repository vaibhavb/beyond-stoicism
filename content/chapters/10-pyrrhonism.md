# Chapter 10: Pyrrhonism

## Chapter Overview
Explore Pyrrho’s path to tranquility by suspending judgment (epoché). You’ll answer Pyrrho’s three questions, practice Agrippa’s modes (disagreement, relativity, regress, assumption, circularity), examine the trilemma in your own reasoning, and use Pyrrhonism’s four criteria for action to live simply while loosening dogmatic grip.

## Day 1: Explore Pyrrho’s Three Fundamental Questions

Answer each question and rate your confidence (1–10).

```qa
{
  "id": "10.1.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Answer Pyrrho’s three questions and record confidence (1–10).",
  "columns": ["Question", "Your answer", "Confidence (1–10)"],
  "rows": 3,
  "prefilled": [
    ["How are things by nature?", "", ""],
    ["What attitude should we adopt toward them?", "", ""],
    ["What will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?", "", ""]
  ]
}
```

[10.1.2] Brief notes on why your confidence is at these levels

## Day 2: Apply the First Two Modes (Disagreement, Relativity)

Attack each of yesterday’s answers using one of the first two Agrippan modes:
- Mode i: Disagreement — others (including experts or traditions) disagree.
- Mode ii: Relativity — appearances vary with relations, conditions, or perspective.

```qa
{
  "id": "10.2.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Challenge each answer with Mode i (disagreement) or Mode ii (relativity), then re-rate confidence.",
  "columns": ["Question", "Your Day 1 answer (optional)", "Mode used (i/ii)", "Refutation (why doubt follows)", "New confidence (1–10)"],
  "rows": 3,
  "prefilled": [
    ["How are things by nature?", "", "", "", ""],
    ["What attitude should we adopt toward them?", "", "", "", ""],
    ["What will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?", "", "", "", ""]
  ]
}
```

## Day 3: Attempt to Avoid Agrippa’s Trilemma

When pressed for justification, arguments risk: infinite regress, arbitrary assumption (hypothesis), or circularity. Try to defend one Day 1 answer while avoiding all three; notice where you land.

```qa
{
  "id": "10.3.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Test your justification against Agrippa’s trilemma: regress, assumption, circularity.",
  "columns": ["Claim (from Day 1)", "Your attempted justification (chain)", "Where it falls (regress/assumption/circularity)", "Confidence after (1–10)", "Notes"],
  "rows": 1
}
```

[10.3.2] If you tried an alternative route, did it still hit one horn of the trilemma? How?

## Day 4: Be Skeptical of Your Daily Thoughts

Go about your day and watch for disturbing thoughts (signals of belief-clinging). Either reword/question them quickly, or later apply Agrippa’s five modes (disagreement, relativity, regress, assumption, circularity).

```qa
{
  "id": "10.4.1",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Log disturbing thoughts and challenge them using Agrippa’s modes.",
  "columns": ["Disturbing thought", "Context/situation", "Quick reframe or question", "Mode used (i/ii/iii/iv/v)", "Result (emotion/confidence shift)"],
  "rows": 6
}
```

[10.4.2] What patterns do you notice about which modes helped most?

---

## Day 5: Ponder the Criteria for Action

Pyrrhonism’s four criteria for action: (1) natural senses and perceptions, (2) feelings, (3) established laws and customs, (4) heeding expert advice. Consider living simply by these criteria and whether that conduces to tranquility.

[10.5.1] Write your view: Would acting by these four criteria promote tranquility for you? Why or why not?

```qa
{
  "id": "10.5.2",
  "type": "table",
  "prompt": "Try a concrete decision using the four criteria.",
  "columns": ["Decision or scenario", "Senses/perceptions", "Feelings", "Laws/customs", "Expert advice", "Action chosen"],
  "rows": 3
}
```

## Final Reflection

After practicing the modes and suspending judgment: How powerful were Agrippa’s modes for inducing epoché? Did you glimpse tranquility? Is loosening dogmatic belief enough, or is more needed? Are the four criteria sufficient to craft a worthwhile life when paired with Pyrrhonian cognitive methods?
